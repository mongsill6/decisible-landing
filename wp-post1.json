  "title": "Amazon FBA Product Launch: 5 Things to Check Before You Bet Your Money",
  "content": "<p>Every year, thousands of Amazon sellers lose money not because they worked hard — but because they launched the wrong product. They had the data. They had Helium10. They had JungleScout. They did everything \"by the book.\"</p>\n\n<p>And they still failed.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong>data tools tell you what's happening. They don't tell you whether you should launch.</strong></p>\n\n<p>After a decade running product launches across consumer electronics, accessories, and outdoor gear categories, I've developed a 5-point checklist that separates products worth betting on from those that will quietly drain your capital.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>Why Helium10 and JungleScout Aren't Enough</h2>\n\n<p>Don't get me wrong — Helium10 and JungleScout are excellent tools. They show you search volume, estimated revenue, keyword difficulty, and competitor metrics. For data collection, they're industry standard.</p>\n\n<p>But here's the gap: <strong>they aggregate the past. They don't synthesize judgment about your specific situation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Seeing that \"insulated water bottle\" gets 150,000 monthly searches tells you demand exists. It doesn't tell you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Whether a new entrant at your price point can realistically capture 1-3% market share</li>\n<li>Whether your specific COGS leaves enough margin after FBA fees and PPC</li>\n<li>Whether bad reviews in the category reveal a differentiation gap you can exploit</li>\n<li>Whether the IP landscape will get you suspended in 90 days</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those are judgment calls. And that's where most sellers either over-rely on gut instinct or, worse, skip them entirely because they don't know what to look for.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the 5 things you need to check before you wire money to a supplier.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>1. Market Demand — Is It Real, Consistent, and Growing?</h2>\n\n<p>High search volume is necessary but not sufficient. You need to dig deeper:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trend direction:</strong> Is demand growing, flat, or declining? A 150,000 monthly search volume that's been shrinking 20% year-over-year is a trap.</li>\n<li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> Is this a year-round product or a 3-month spike? Camping gear that peaks in May-July requires different inventory strategy than evergreen household items.</li>\n<li><strong>Organic vs. PPC-driven demand:</strong> Check if top sellers are ranking organically or burning budget on ads to maintain visibility. If 80% of top-10 listings are sponsored, the organic moat is gone — everyone's paying to play.</li>\n<li><strong>Review velocity:</strong> Categories with 50+ reviews/month per top product indicate sustained purchase activity, not just initial hype.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Search volume above 100,000 but fewer than 3 products with 1,000+ reviews = category is newer/riskier than it appears.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>2. Competition — Can You Realistically Grab 1-3% Share?</h2>\n\n<p>This is where most sellers make their biggest mistake. They see high revenue numbers from top competitors and assume the pie is big enough for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>What they miss:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brand concentration:</strong> If 3 brands control 60%+ of category revenue, you're not entering a market — you're trying to chip away at a fortress.</li>\n<li><strong>Review wall:</strong> Top products with 10,000-50,000 reviews took years to accumulate. You can't buy your way to that trust quickly. If you launch into this environment, expect to lose money for 12-18 months building review equity.</li>\n<li><strong>PPC cost reality:</strong> Check average CPC for your target keywords. If top keywords cost $2.50-4.00 per click with 4-6% conversion, your customer acquisition cost could be $40-100 for a $25 product. That's not a business — that's a charity.</li>\n<li><strong>New entrant success rate:</strong> Look at products launched in the last 12 months. How many reached 100+ reviews? If fewer than 20% did, the category is hostile to new entrants.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The honest question:</strong> \"Why would an Amazon customer choose my product over the established players?\" If your answer is \"it's cheaper\" or \"similar quality,\" that's not a strategy — that's a race to the bottom.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>3. Margin Viability — Does the Math Actually Work?</h2>\n\n<p>This is non-negotiable. You need 25%+ net margin after all costs to build a sustainable business. Most sellers calculate this incorrectly because they forget items.</p>\n\n<p>Full cost structure check:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>COGS</strong> (product + packaging + quality inspection + shipping to Amazon)</li>\n<li><strong>FBA fees</strong> (referral fee 8-15% + fulfillment fee by size/weight)</li>\n<li><strong>PPC budget</strong> (conservatively 15-25% of revenue in competitive categories)</li>\n<li><strong>Returns and refunds</strong> (budget 3-8% depending on category)</li>\n<li><strong>Storage fees</strong> (especially Q4 long-term storage if you over-order)</li>\n<li><strong>Platform fees and currency conversion</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Example reality check:</strong> A $30 product with $8 COGS sounds like 73% gross margin. After FBA fees ($5), PPC ($6), returns ($1.50), and overhead ($1.50), you net $8 — barely 26%. And that's before you account for initial launch spending to build velocity.</p>\n\n<p>If the math doesn't clearly work on paper, it definitely won't work in execution.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>4. Differentiation — What Do Bad Reviews Reveal?</h2>\n\n<p>This is the most underutilized research step. Most sellers read top reviews to validate demand. The smarter play is reading the 1-star and 2-star reviews to find the product gap.</p>\n\n<p>What you're looking for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recurring complaints:</strong> If 30%+ of negative reviews mention the same issue (leaking, durability, misleading sizing, difficult assembly), that's a real gap.</li>\n<li><strong>Price-to-expectation mismatch:</strong> Customers complaining that a $20 product feels cheap signals room for a better-quality option at $28-32.</li>\n<li><strong>Missing features customers want:</strong> \"I wish it came with a carrying case\" or \"would be perfect if it had a warranty\" — these are free product improvement briefs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The differentiation question isn't \"is my product slightly better?\" It's: <strong>\"Is my improvement significant enough that customers will choose me over established competitors with 10x more reviews?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>A 15% quality improvement is not enough. A solved pain point that 35% of buyers complain about? That's a wedge.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>5. Launch Risk — What's the Minimum Viable Bet?</h2>\n\n<p>Even good products can fail due to launch execution risk. Evaluate:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Minimum order quantity:</strong> If your supplier requires 1,000 units minimum and you need 3 months to sell through, that's $8,000-15,000 sitting in Amazon warehouses during your validation period. Can you afford to be wrong?</li>\n<li><strong>IP and trademark risks:</strong> Do any top competitors have design patents on product features? Brand registry protection? A suspension 60 days into launch can be business-ending.</li>\n<li><strong>Supplier reliability:</strong> First-time suppliers need test orders. Budget for at least one quality control failure before you find a reliable partner.</li>\n<li><strong>Time to first sale:</strong> From purchase order to Amazon warehouse to first organic sale is typically 90-120 days. You need runway for this. If you're cash-constrained, this timeline will break you.</li>\n<li><strong>Category restrictions:</strong> Some categories require Amazon approval. Others have specific compliance requirements (electrical safety, chemical labeling). Research these before committing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>The 5-Point Scorecard</h2>\n\n<p>Before any launch decision, run your product through these 5 dimensions and score each 1-10:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Market Demand</strong> — Real, growing, not driven by hype</li>\n<li><strong>Competition</strong> — Room for a new entrant to capture 1-3% share</li>\n<li><strong>Margin Viability</strong> — 25%+ net after all costs</li>\n<li><strong>Differentiation</strong> — A specific, solvable gap in existing products</li>\n<li><strong>Launch Risk</strong> — Acceptable MOQ, no IP landmines, clear timeline</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Score below 30/50 total? Don't launch. Score 35+? Worth serious consideration. Score 40+? Execute fast.</p>\n\n<p>The point isn't to find perfect products — it's to make informed bets. Every launch carries risk. The goal is to make sure the risk is worth taking.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>Let AI Run This Checklist for You</h2>\n\n<p>Running this 5-point analysis manually takes hours.
